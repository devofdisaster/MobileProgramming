                Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot.
                Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they
                decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs.
                Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

                Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best.
                Every time you come home, they act like they haven't seen you in a year. And the good thing about
                dogs... is they got different dogs for different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of dogs.
                Pit bull can be the right man's best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy.
                You going to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.
